In this virtual diorama you are supposed to find various medieval construction items in an abandoned castle and report back your progress to three different master craftsmen (a smith, a mason and a carpenter). There are two categories of items to be found (materials and tools). The modular castle with its spiral staircases and creaking doors is the main attraction (remember to switch on the sound icon after hitting play...). I love making dioramas: creating and adding assets that you can interact with is a lot of the fun of working with Unity. 
What use is a 3D-printed castle paperweight after a while if you cannot climb inside it and walk around ? 
The trees and the grasses are from the Unity Asset Store (Conifers Package by the amazing Forst, 
free Grass Flowers Pack by Aleksey Pakhalchuk).
